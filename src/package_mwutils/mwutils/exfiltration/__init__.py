"""Exfiltration

The adversary is trying to steal data.

Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. 
Once theyâ€™ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. 
This can include compression and encryption. 
Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring 
it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may
 also include putting size limits on the transmission.
